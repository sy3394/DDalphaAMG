The DDalphaAMG solver library is an inverter for Wilson-Clover fermions from lattice QCD.

This is the branch sy3394/master: it includes the solver library for twisted mass fermions
     with capability of simultaneous inversion of multiple rhs

INSTALL:

  The main directory contains an example for Makefile. This makefile needs
  a few adjustments (compiler and MPI library) before compiling the code on 
  your machine. Please note, that the code was built in a 
  generic precision. Thus, the actual code for compilation is created by 
  the makefile via pattern substitution right before the compilation.
  This part of the makefile should not be removed.
  Once the necessary adjustments of the makefile are done, the command 
  "make -f yourmakefile -j execs"
  should compile the whole entire Wilson solver code, such that it is
  ready to be run. The makefile contains additional rules "library" and
  "documentation" for compiling the code as a library and for compiling
  the user documentation as well as "exec-tests" for compiling a test routine
  and "install" to make an install directory specified via setting PREFIX variable.
  The library interface can be found in the "include" folder.

HOWTO:

  After having compiled the user documentation via
  "make documentation" please consult the compiled PDF in /doc for
  further information.
